## Bully

The Rockstar Games production Bully, released in 2006, is a spritual predecessor to Sleeping Dogs. They share the same lead designer (Mike Skupa) and combat gameplay programmer (Liberty Walker). The action gameplay of both titles looks very similar when compared alongside each other.

## Triad Wars

Triad Wars was conceived as a free-to-play follow up to Sleeping Dogs, built from the same tech and set in the same universe. Triad Wars gameplay was inspired by popular asynchronous online games like Clash of Clans. It started development in late 2013 and entered open beta in early 2015. It was cancelled in December of 2015.
