# Magic the Gathering - Game Formats

Cheat sheet for various ways of playing MtG.

## Draft Formats

### Booster Draft

Any number of players sit in a circle and start with 3 unopened booster packs. For each round, each player opens one booster pack, inspects the cards from it, takes one card, and passes the rest of the cards clockwise (for the first and third rounds; counter-clockwise for the second round.) Players continue selecting and passing cards until none are left. The players build 40 card decks from their drafted cards.

### Cube Draft

A variant where instead of using booster packs to populate card pools, cards are randomly selected from a pre-determined pool of cards call the Cube. Piles of 15 random cards can stand-in for each booster pack.

### Manchester Draft

Start with 3 unopened booster packs for each player. For each round, open one booster back and place all of the cards it contains face-up in the middle. Players take turns selecting a card in clockwise order. Select and initial starting player at random and move the starting position clockwise for each round.

This format can be very slow.

### Winston Draft

Two players alternate selecting from a pool of 90 cards. To start, deal the top three cards face down into one-card piles. On each player's turn, starting with the first pile the player may see what cards are in the pile. That player either takes the pile or moves on to the next pile. Each time a pile is passed over, a card is added to it face-down (unless there are no more cards.) If a player passes over all three piles, they must take a card from the top of the pool. The players build 40 card decks from their drafted cards.

### Winchester Draft

Two players alternate selecting from a pool of 90 cards. To start, deal four cards face up into one-card piles. On each player's turn, the player takes the cards from one of the piles, and afterward a card is dealt face-up into each of the piles (unless there are no more cards.)

## Constructed Formats

### Standard

Only the most recent Core Set and the six other most recent sets.

### Pioneer

Only cards from the Return to Ravnica set onward.

### Modern

Only new-bordered cards. Typically starting from the Mirrodin set.

### Classic

Only old-bordered cards. Typically ending with the Scourge set.

### Block / Set

Pick one of the MtG blocks / sets and only use cards from that block / set.

### Pauper

Only commons allowed.

### Peasant

Only commons and uncommons allowed, with a deck limit of 5 uncommons.

### Penny Dreadful

Only low-value commons allowed. "Low-value" is typically defined as being traded for 1/100th of a ticket or less on MTGO, but could be decided by a ban list.

### Cube

Uses an arbitrary card list.

### Commander

Each deck is 100 cards and lead by a legendary creature designated the "commander." Cards in the deck can only be of one of the commander's colours. (Lots of other rules.)

Also known as Elder Dragon Highlander.

## Player Arrangements

### Gathering

Five players sit in a circle. Each player wins if the two players sitting across (not neighbouring) them are defeated.

For a true gathering, have each of the five players play a mono-color deck that matches the seating order as depicted on the back of a MtG card: clock-wise, from the top, that order is white, blue, black, red, and green.

### Emporer

Six players form two teams of three. Each team has an "emperor" player seated between two "general" players. Generals can only attack or target players who are adjacent, such that each general can only attack the opposing emporer if their neighbouring general is defeated first. Emporers can target players up to two places away, such that they can target the same players as their generals can. The team whose emporer is defeated first loses.

### Two-Headed Giant

Four players form two teams of two. Each team shares a life total starting at 40.

## Other Formats

### Mental Magic

Players play constructed decks, but every card can be cast as any other card with the same mana cost as long as the player can accurately recall what that card is called and what its rules are.

### Momir Basic

Each player plays a 61 card deck that contains the Avatar "Momir Vig, Simic Visionary" and 60 basic lands.

It is difficult to play this card without the aid of a computer since this format requires a way of drawing randomized creatures for each converted mana cost.

### Chaos Magic

When a player is defeated, the player with the highest life total wins (works best with many players.) There is no limit on how many copies of a card a player can have in their deck. Life totals are kept secret.
